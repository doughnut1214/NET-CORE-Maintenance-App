# NET-CORE-Maintenance-App
Web App featuring maintenance ticket creation and responses.
This is an example project with basic features such as:
-A few Tables and functional CRUD operations scaffoldings
-Individual Account Authentication 
-3rd party Email validation service with Sendgrid
-Role based Authorization

It was a really interesting project to create, and it helped me learn a lot about how an MVC application functions.
